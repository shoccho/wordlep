# This is not something that you might want to use if you genuinly want help in solving wordle puzzles. This is more like a proof of concept.

just to test if I can make something like this or not. Be free to fork and improve upon the code (there is a lot to improve on)

Currently only developed for firefox 

Might build/test later on chrome/chromium (no guarantees on that)
